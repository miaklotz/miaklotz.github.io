    <p>The Open Access logo feels representative of my work because in both my job at the library and in my technical writing classes, I practice creating documents that are accessible. Accessibility in publishing has been a constant throughout my time at UMass and I feel that this image does a great job of representing that aspect of my work.</p>

    <p>This image of books is representative of my work because as an English major I work with literature everyday and have a strong passion for both reading and writing. I am also intersted in publishing and a lot of my work samples reflect book publishing in regards to Open Access.</p>

    <p>This image was taken during my time studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain. I would like to highlight my photography on my website, so I felt as though an image representing the photography I have done in the past would work well with my writing samples. I would also like to highlight my study abroad experience in my website as well, including the work I completed for both my Photography and Documentary classes.</p>
