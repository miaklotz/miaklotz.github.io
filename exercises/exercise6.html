                <p>I am a senior English major studying at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am currently pursuing a certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication and have completed a specilization in Writing, Rhetoric, and Literary Studies.</p>
                <p>I have worked at the W.E.B. Du Bois Library in the Scholarly Communications Office at UMass Amherst for the past three years and have gained hands-on experience sharing and finding open educational resourses (OER). Through this job I have spoken at an Open Access Week Panel, presented at two different Honors classes on searching for OER, and am currently working on my Honors Thesis where I am providing OER to a rural school in South America.</p>
                <p>I am also an Editorial and Design Production intern at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Press where I work on making edits for page corrections, organizing the Press' archive, proofing, creating character counts, and uploading books to Manifold, the Press' Open Access website. </p>
               <p>Through completing the certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication, I have found that an aspect I really enjoy is accessiblility. My research and scholarly work throughout my time at UMass has had a strong focus around open-access information and publishing.</p>
                <p>I am very passionate about a career in technical writing and would love to bring my past and current experience into a new role!</p>
