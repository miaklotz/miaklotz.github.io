        <h1>W.E.B. Du Bois Library Falcon Cam</h1>
        <h2>Fun Facts and History</h2>
    <p>Have you ever been curious about the history of the Pelegrine falcons that live on the top of W.E.B. Du Bois Library? Well luckily since 2012, UMass has set up a falcon cam for the university to view these birds up close.</p>

        <h3>A Brief Overview</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Peregrine falcons have successfully nested on the roof of the Du Bois Library at UMass Amherst since 2003. The most well known pair, which nested on the Library roof from 2003-2014, hatched a total of 37 chicks!</li>
        <li>A live web camera was installed atop the Du Bois Library in 2012, allowing the public to watch the pair raise their chicks, and garnering more than 200,000 viewers in 2014-double the audience in 2012.</li>
        </ul>
