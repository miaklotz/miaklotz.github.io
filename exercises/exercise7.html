                <h2>Grant Proposal for students in Nucchu, Bolivia</h2>
                <p>My grant proposal, submitted to The Global Partnership for Education, seeked funding to provide 20 new HP laptops to the U.E. German Busch Primary School in Nucchu, Bolivia. With limited access to educational resources, internet, and finances, the students in this rural school face significant barriers to learning. By partnering with the World Librarians program, which has previously supported schools in Malawi and Kenya, this project aims to provide the children of Nucchu with essential technology to access educational resources and bridge the gap to a brighter future.</p>

                <h2>Final Photography Project-Hands in Barcelona</h2>
                <p>For our final assignment in Photography in Barcelona we had to choose a concept and produce 10-12 photos expressing that concept. We had free range on what concept we wanted to explore and were encouraged to try something outside of our comfort zone. I chose to focus on hands and the human connection in Barcelona. These were the 12 images I felt depicted this theme.</p>
