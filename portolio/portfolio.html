                    <h1>Grant Proposal for students in Nucchu, Bolivia</h1>
                    <p>My grant proposal, submitted to The Global Partnership for Education, seeked funding to provide 20 new HP laptops to the U.E. German Busch Primary School in Nucchu, Bolivia. With limited access to educational resources, internet, and finances, the students in this rural school face significant barriers to learning. By partnering with the World Librarians program, which has previously supported schools in Malawi and Kenya, this project aims to provide the children of Nucchu with essential technology to access educational resources and bridge the gap to a brighter future.</p>

                    <p>A Collection of Ghost Stories and the Unknown is a book I created in my Book Design course using InDesign.

                    <h1>Accessibility Website Using MadCap Flare</h1>
                    <p>For one of my Professional Writing and Technical Communication courses, our semester long project was to use MadCap Flare to create a resource (a set of "topic pages") that showcases our ability to write knowledgeably on the subject of digital accessibility. For my MadCap Flare wesbite I chose to focus on the WCAG Guidelines and specifically the POUR Principles. Through this project, I learned and mastered MadCap Flare and researched and developed topic pages for an area of accessibility that I am passionate about.</p>

                    <h1>Honors Thesis Proposal 1</h1>
                    <p>As part of the World Librarians Organization at the University of Massachusetts Amherst we work to provide free, openly licensed educational materials to schools in Kenya and Malawi Africa. Our goal has always been to expand the schools we support and through my honor's thesis I added the U.E. German Busch School which is located in Nucchu, Bolivia to the World Librarians program. For my thesis, the first proposal focuses on the research, testing, and learning process that is necessary before heading to Bolivia to start the ground work for the technology and program we are going to implement. This proposal was submitted my first semester of my senior year before I took my trip to Bolivia to bring the World Librarians program to Nucchu.</p>

                    <p>For my honors thesis, I'm working with a device called the RACHEL (Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning), which provides offline access to educational resources but lacks documentation in languages other than English. These three instructional videos consist of (1) Powering on the RACHEL, (2) Uploading Content onto the RACHEL, and (3) Powering off the RACHEL. I also translated a starter guide from the non-profit World Possible and added my own notes and troubleshooting tips to make the device more accessible.</p>

                    <p>In Fall 2024, I applied for a honors research grant for money to purchase chromebooks and tablets for the school in Bolivia for my honors thesis. I wasn't awarded the money to buy the technology, but they awarded $1,000 for my travel expenses. I then created a go-fund me to purchase the technology for the school. Due to this grant, I was then able to present in the Massachusetts Undergraduate Research Conference this year.</p>

                    <h1>Photography in Barcelona</h1>
                    <p>In the spring of 2024, I had the amazing opportunity to study abroad in Barcelona, Spain. While there, I got to take a class called Photography in Barcelona. In this class, we were told to explore the city, take pictures, and return to class to edit those photos. Through these assignments, I was able to get lost in the city but also find my love for photography again.</p>

                 <p>In my photojournalism course we also had an assignment where we were asked to create a feature story with someone else in our class. For our feature story, we wanted to choose a restaurant or small business that is competing in the food industry in Barcelona. With an increase in tourism since the pandemic, we wanted to focus on a specific restaurant that is thriving in Barcelona today. We chose the restaurant, Cañete, because of its growing popularity and the buzzing word of mouth that had spread about the atmosphere, food, and people.  </p>
